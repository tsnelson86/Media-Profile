			<img id="picture" src="assets/images/Picture.png" />
			<p>I graduated from Colorado State University in 2009 with a BS in Marketing. Since then, I have spent about 9 years working at marketing agencies where I specialized in SEO, PPC, Email Marketing, Page Optimization, and Social Media Marketing. Currently, I am working at a SaaS company, where I am a Sr. Client Success Manager. We work with many large manufacturing brands, such as Panasonic, Sony, LG, Whirlpool, Bosch, ICON Fitness, and Electrolux. In my role as a CSM I manage client relationships, develop account strategy, and manage website projects for our customers.</p>
			<br />
			<p>I'm excited to get more involved in coding after working in the marketing world for the last 9 years. Hopefully what we learn in class will be very valuable to me down the road to help me better understand the work that is done at many technology companies that I would want to work at in the near future.</p>
